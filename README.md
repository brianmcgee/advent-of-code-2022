## Advent of Code 2022 - :crab: Rust :crab:

Having dabbled a little bit here and there over the last few years I've not really spent the time and made a concerted effort to learn Rust.
So when I saw [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) come across my [Fosstodon Feed](https://fosstodon.org/@bmcgee84) I thought "fuck it, why not?"
since I find myself with an unusual amount of free time over the next while.
